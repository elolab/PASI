PASI 1.0:
- original

PASI 1.1:
- Bug fixed (default value was used too easily in noise level detection).
- Bug fixed (representing Entrez id for type 'gene' nodes was accidentally selected randomly in case only one of them was measured).
- PASI now accesses KEGG pathways directly via API, so the user doesn't have to download the pathway files.

PASI 1.2:
- Input simplified
- Input data directly Entrez instead of probe id and mapping
- Parts requiring external packages excluded (DE gene detection, visualization)
- Score-option added (default: final score represents pathway activity rather than deregulation)
